# amaranth_sandbox
A collection of experimentations using the amaranth HDL framework

## Install the toolchain

For ease of use, I downloads the linux build of [OSS CAD Suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build).

Then, before working, I source the environment using `. /path/to/oss/cad/environment`.

## Prerequisite reading

I skimmed over the nMigen tutorials and videos of Robert Baruch. You should read/view those for the basics of nMigen/amaranth.

* Tutorials of Robert Baruch : https://github.com/RobertBaruch/nmigen-tutorial
* Videos : [Building a 6800 CPU on an FPGA with nMigen](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEeZWGE3PwbbjxV7_XnPSR7ouLR2zjktw)

About formal verification, a little bit of reading about _SymbiYosys_ (`sby`) is helpful :
