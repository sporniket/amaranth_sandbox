# amaranth_sandbox
A collection of experimentations using the amaranth HDL framework

## Install the toolchain

For ease of use, I downloads the linux build of [OSS CAD Suite](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build).

Then, before working, I source the environment using `. /path/to/oss/cad/environment`.

## Prerequisite reading

I skimmed over the nMigen tutorials and video of Robert Baruch. You should read/view those for the basics of nMigen/amaranth.
